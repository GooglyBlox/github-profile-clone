# GitHub Profile Clone

A slightly modified visual recreation of GitHub's user profile page (with some additional creative liberty) built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create `.env` file with either:
   - `GITHUB_API_KEY` for full access
   - `GITHUB_USERNAME` for public access only
4. Run development server: `npm run dev`
